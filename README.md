# Low Smart Sensor Module for Real-Time Automatic Switching Device
# üîå ESP32-CAM Smart Relay Controller üö®

A **Low-Power Smart Sensor Module** for real-time automatic switching using **ESP32-CAM**, **PIR sensor**, and **Edge AI** to detect human presence and control electrical loads efficiently.

---

## üì∏ Project Overview

This project leverages the ESP32-CAM board's onboard camera and deep sleep functionality to build a low-power, intelligent automation system. It combines **motion detection (PIR)** and **vision-based human detection (Edge Impulse)** to trigger a **relay switch**, optimizing energy usage in real-time.

üß† Key Features:
- Human detection using camera and PIR sensor
- AI inference using Edge Impulse model
- Relay control based on presence
- Deep Sleep for ultra-low power consumption
- Serial data logging via PuTTY (COM @ 115200 baud)
- Local Access Point server (optional for web dashboard)
