# esp32cam-pir-relay-controller
This project implements a low-cost, energy-efficient smart automation system using the ESP32-CAM, PIR sensor, and Edge AI. It detects human presence through motion and camera-based inference, then controls electrical appliances via relay switchingâ€”ideal for smart homes, energy-saving systems, and IoT deployments.
